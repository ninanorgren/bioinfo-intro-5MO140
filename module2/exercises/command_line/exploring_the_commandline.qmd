##  üéØ Objective

Practice fundamental command-line skills by navigating through directories, creating new folders, and manipulating files.

</span>


##### 2. Navigate to the Home Directory:  
- Use the `cd` command to navigate to your home directory.

```bash
cd ~
```


Create a New Folder:

Create a new folder named "bioinformatics_exercise."
bash
Copy code
mkdir bioinformatics_exercise
Navigate to the New Folder:

Move into the newly created folder.
bash
Copy code
cd bioinformatics_exercise
Create Files:

Create two empty text files named "file1.txt" and "file2.txt."
bash
Copy code
touch file1.txt file2.txt
Display File Contents:

Use the cat command to display the contents of "file1.txt."
bash
Copy code
cat file1.txt
Copy Files:

Create a backup folder and copy both files into it.
bash
Copy code
mkdir backup
cp file1.txt file2.txt backup/
Move Files:

Move "file1.txt" to the backup folder.
bash
Copy code
mv file1.txt backup/
View Folder Structure:

Use the tree command to visualize the folder structure.
bash
Copy code
tree
Clean Up:

Remove the original "file1.txt" from the current folder.
bash
Copy code
rm file1.txt
Final Check:

Confirm that the "file1.txt" is now only in the backup folder.
bash
Copy code
ls backup/
Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully navigated through directories, created folders, manipulated files, and used basic commands in the command line.

Feel free to explore more commands and experiment with different scenarios to enhance your command-line skills.
